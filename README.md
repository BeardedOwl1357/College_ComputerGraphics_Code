# Code and Related Files
Greetings, I am a student of Computer Science studying in **Thapar Institute Of Engineering And Technology**(2023 Batch) 
1. I will be storing Computer Graphics code AND some theory material on this repository
2. Some of the code will be in ```python``` (jupyter notebook) AS it can help in basic understanding of Algorithms
3. We are taught ```OpenGL``` framework in this semster therefore I will be primarily uploading C++ Code
I wish it helps you somehow.

# Installation
It is recommended to install openGL on a linux machine (Ubuntu for example). Personally, I prefer installing and using openGL on an Ubuntu Virtual Machine rather than installing it on windows
## Creating a vitrual machine

## Installing some useful tools
The shell file (.sh) will be avaialble under the ```"0_Installation"``` folder. After downloading it in linux machine, execute the following command ```sudo install.sh``` (For this to work, Navigate to the directory where the script is being kept) **THIS IS GENERALLY NOT ADVISABLE TO RUN AN UNKNOWN BASH SCRIPT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO CHECK THE SCRIPT FOR YOURSELF AND VALIDATE WHETHER IT IS DOING IT WHAT I HAVE INTENDED FOR IT TO DO (TO INSTALL THE SOFTWARE)**  

It installs some tools and essentials such as
1. **g++** : C++ compiler
2. **gcc** : C compiler
3. **vim** : A really good text editor. If you get your hand set on this editor, this will make your "code writing" efficient. A beautiful text editor in my opinion
4. **Terminator** : An upgrade to the inbuilt terminal used in Linux systems. It allows you to split a terminal in 2 which can be further split. (Just use it and then you will realise how cool is it)
5. **GLUT** : The thing which will allow you to use openGL in linux
