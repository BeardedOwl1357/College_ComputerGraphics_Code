# Code and Related Files
Greetings, I am a student of Computer Science studying in **Thapar Institute Of Engineering And Technology**(2023 Batch) 
1. I will be storing Computer Graphics code AND some theory material on this repository
2. Some of the code will be in ```python``` (jupyter notebook) AS it can help in basic understanding of Algorithms
3. We are taught ```OpenGL``` framework in this semster therefore I will be primarily uploading C++ Code
I wish it helps you somehow.
